description: >
  Use this to audit project documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, API docs,
  wikis, in-repo .md files) against what the codebase actually does now, and
  prune or update what's stale — "review the docs", "are the docs out of
  date", "clean up the README", "docs don't match the code anymore", or after
  a release/major refactor before tagging; NOT for session context
  (context-compression), NOT for code structure (architecture-review), and
  NOT for authoring substantial net-new documentation from scratch.

# Docs Audit Skill

Documentation drifts because writing it is a one-time act and the code keeps
changing. This skill treats docs the same way `context-compression` treats
session memory: classify each claim as current, stale, or dead, and act on
that classification instead of leaving everything to accumulate. Model: `standard`
for a single doc, `deep` if cross-referencing docs against a large or unfamiliar
codebase.

## Iron Law

Every concrete claim is verified against the current code before it's classified —
because fluent prose is not evidence of accuracy, and the exact failure this skill
targets is a well-written doc describing a codebase that no longer exists.

## Red Flags — Rationalizations to Refuse

| Excuse the agent might generate | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| "This README reads confidently and consistently — it's probably accurate; I'll spot-check a couple of claims." | Internal consistency is the failure mode, not evidence against it. Docs stay fluent long after the code moves. | Check each concrete claim (command, flag, path, example) by grep against the source. |
| "This section is stale, but rewriting means understanding the new behaviour — I'll add a caveat note instead." | A wrong doc with a caveat is still a wrong doc; the caveat just spreads the doubt to the accurate parts. | Update it to match reality, or delete it. Those are the only two outcomes for stale. |
| "This old section might still help someone — I'll keep it just in case." | Dead descriptions mislead more than absence: a reader following removed instructions loses more time than one finding nothing. | Age isn't the criterion; accuracy is. Dead → delete. |

## Step 1: Scope

- **Single doc** — one file flagged as suspect (fastest path)
- **Full pass** — every `.md` in the repo, README outward
- **Post-release** — triggered by release-prep or a version bump; check for
  version numbers, deprecated flags, changed defaults

```bash
find . -name "*.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.git/*"
```

Don't open every file for a single-doc scope. Bound the read.

---

## Step 2: Classify Each Claim, Not the Whole File

Read the doc section by section. For each concrete claim (a command, a flag, a
file path, a code example, an architectural statement), check it against the
current codebase — grep for it, don't assume it's still true because it reads
confidently.

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Current** | Matches the code as it exists now | Keep as-is |
| **Stale** | Was true, isn't anymore (renamed, moved, changed behavior) | Update to match reality |
| **Dead** | Describes something removed entirely | Delete, don't leave a corrected description of a thing that no longer exists |
| **Undocumented** | Code does something the docs never mention | Flag as a gap — write it if in scope, else log it |
| **Aspirational** | Describes intended-but-never-shipped behavior | Delete or clearly mark as planned, don't let it read as current |

The failure mode this step targets specifically: docs that are internally
consistent and well-written but describe a version of the code that no longer
exists. Fluent prose is not evidence of accuracy — check against the source.

## Step 3: Apply Aging Rules

Same principle as memory aging — a doc that only ever grows misleads more than
it helps:

- Superseded instructions (old install method still listed alongside the new
  one) → remove the old, don't append the new next to it
- Changelogs/release notes belong in `CHANGELOG.md`, not scattered across README
  history sections — if found duplicated, keep one source of truth
- Examples using deprecated APIs → rewrite to current API, don't caveat in place
- TODO/FIXME comments describing docs work older than the repo's active branch
  age → resolve or drop, don't let them fossilize
- If `.claude/architecture.json` exists (dev-workflow), cross-check structural
  claims in docs against it — mismatches mean one of the two is now wrong

---

## Step 4: Report and Act

```
## Docs Audit: [scope]

**Files reviewed:** [N]
**Current:** [N claims/sections — no output needed for these]
**Updated:** [file:section] — [what changed, old → new]
**Deleted:** [file:section] — [why: describes removed feature / superseded / duplicate]
**Gaps found:** [feature/behavior with no docs] — [logged as issue / written now, per scope]

**Not touched, and why:** [anything intentionally left, e.g. external doc site out of scope]
```

For a full pass, make the edits directly rather than just reporting — this
skill's job is pruning, not just flagging (unlike architecture-review, which
only assesses). For gaps requiring net-new substantial writing, log via
`gh issue create` rather than drafting speculative content inline.

## Rules

- Never keep a stale claim because rewriting it is more work than leaving it —
  a wrong doc is worse than no doc
- Don't delete a section just because it's old; delete it because it's wrong
  or duplicated — age alone isn't the criterion, accuracy is
- Verify against the actual code (grep, read the file), never against memory
  of what the code "probably still does"
- Keep the same tone/voice as the surrounding doc when updating — don't make
  edited sections stylistically stick out
- If a doc claim can't be verified (e.g. describes external infra not in this
  repo), say so explicitly rather than guessing at current/stale/dead
